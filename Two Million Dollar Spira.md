**Title: "Two Million Dollar Spiral"**

---

**Verse 1:**

Two million dollar wet dream,  
Living life on a golden beam.  
Felt the world was mine to take,  
Every move, a perfect mistake.  

Then came the paper, thin as smoke,  
Signed my name, the pen just broke.  
Two million dollar empty check,  
A future that I can’t protect.  

---

**Chorus:**

Oh, the rise, the fall, the echo screams,  
From riches to ruins, shattering dreams.  
Two million dollar lose,  
No winning left to choose.  

Oh, the cost keeps climbing still,  
Two million dollar bail, and then the bill.  
From heaven’s height to the fiery moat,  
Now I hold a hell bank note.  

---

**Verse 2:**

Two million dollar bail to pay,  
Freedom bought but it slips away.  
Chains unseen, they bind my soul,  
The system takes its endless toll.  

Two million dollar medical bill,  
Fighting fate but losing will.  
A body broken, a heart of stone,  
Falling deeper, all alone.  

---

**Chorus:**

Oh, the rise, the fall, the echo screams,  
From riches to ruins, shattering dreams.  
Two million dollar lose,  
No winning left to choose.  

Oh, the cost keeps climbing still,  
Two million dollar bail, and then the bill.  
From heaven’s height to the fiery moat,  
Now I hold a hell bank note.  

---

**Bridge:**

In the underworld, I find my truth,  
Pay the price for wasted youth.  
The demons laugh, the ledger’s clear,  
But the scars remain, and so does fear.  

Two million dollars to resolve my fate,  
In a realm where it’s far too late.  
Trading paper for peace of mind,  
But redemption’s not the kind you find.  

---

**Outro:**

Two million dollar wet dream,  
A shadow now, a fading gleam.  
What was gained, what was lost,  
Counting every painful cost.  

Two million dollar hell bank note,  
Burning bright as the debts I wrote.  
And the spiral spins, the story ends,  
Two million dollars I can’t defend.
